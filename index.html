        <p>Beautiful gardens are at the heart of any community. Willow Gardens' provide an entry point for individuals
            and
            households to get involved in the whole project. Community gardeners use the land to grow their own food,
            which
            has a positive impact on their household food security. We provide recreational outdoor activity as well as
            a
            fun and friendly environment for people of all ages, incomes, and cultures to work the land together and
            share
            their gardening knowledge and ideas. Gardeners assist in site maintenance and management through volunteer
            commitments.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of very nice garden spots available.</p>
